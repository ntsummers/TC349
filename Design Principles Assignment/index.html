                    <strong> Principle: </strong> Ockham's Razor. This site understands it has a great design the compliments the functionality, not the other way around. I love this site.

                    <strong> Principle: </strong> Signal to noise. Name one noisy thing about this site, other then the sounds that it plays. You can't, it's just that simple.

                    <strong> Principle: </strong> Chunking. This site is great. All the information is clearly defined, there is no noise, and it simply does exactly what you want it to do. Best take on a recipe site yet.

                    <br/>
                    <strong> Principle: </strong> Hick's Law. There are so few choices, yet so much information here its incredible. Take a journey on this site and you'll be amazed at what you find!

                    <strong> Principle: </strong> Rule of Thirds. Heres a site that gets the rule of thirds. The right column is 300px. The left column is 597px. 597 + 300 = 897. 300/897 = .334. Pretty darn good I'd say.

            <h3> The Bad </h3>
            
            <ol> 

                <li> 
                    <a href="http://cavs.mit.edu/"> Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Advanced Visual Studies</a> 
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                    <strong> Issue: </strong> Ockham's Razor. With Ockham's razor, you want to have a simple design if the functionalities are the same. This site proves that a simple, yet down right ugly and brutal to the eyes design might not be the best. The functionality could have been put in cleaner, distinct locations and not put around the horrible design. Fix this.

                    <br/>
                    <strong> Issue: </strong> Signal to Noise. This site has a low signal to noise ratio. I don't know what I'm doing on this site. The information is sporadic, and there are a million things to click, yet all leading to the exact same thing that I wasn't looking for to begin with.

                    <br/>
                    <strong> Issue: </strong> Chunking. Besides a lot of other design choices on this site, the chunking for the site is terrible. This is especially shown by looking at their mobile view of the site: <a href="http://cas.msu.edu/explore/"> Here</a>. Not only is the site horribly laid out and nothing lines up with anything, they have terrible chunking with their nav. Two menu buttons? What does what? I didn't even know there was a second menu button and couldn't get to the information I wanted on the page

                    <br/>
                    <strong> Issue: </strong> Hick's Law. I'm beating a dead horse here, so just read the issue about Chunking to also see issues of Hicks Law, as well as the Signal to Noise about how many things there are to click.

                    <br/>
                    <strong> Issue: </strong> Rule of Thirds. Despite destroying Hick's law completely, this site is terrible with the rule of thirds. There is no 33% here, only a cluttered website full of information that goes in random directions.
