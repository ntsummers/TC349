 ------------------------ Notes About Dribble Pictures -------------------


City -> The reason I chose the picture of the city is because I used to play Sim City all the time as a kid. Even with the recent lackluster remake, I still love the idea, and even toyed with the idea of becoming an Urban Planner myself. This picture resonates with me due to its artistic style that I've come to love from the Sim City games, and the memories it envokes. 

Extraordinary -> The Extraordinary website picture was chosen because it actually made me like the block design that websites are going towards these days. Normally I don't like that type of style, but recently, the class site and this site have made me think differently about it. I really like the attention to detail in the typography, and keeping the same style throughout the page. 

Motorcycle -> This motorcycle picture does a great job using the minimalist art style. I might have liked to see more than one color used, but maybe thats also why I like it. Because its so simplistic, it helped draw me to the logo.
